# Github Issue Slugifier Bookmarklet
The purpose of this script is to make it easy to generate a branch name for every github issue. It is a small javascript script based on a similar PivotalTracker script written by https://github.com/caseywatts.

## How To Use

This code is used as a javascript bookmarklet. It is a bookmark in your browser that executes some javascript code, instead of navigating you to a new page.

1. Copy the code block in `github-issue-slugifier.js`
2. Create a new bookmark, maybe on your `Bookmarks Bar` for quick access.
  1. Name it something (like `slugit`)
    2. Paste the code block into `Location` (or `URL`).
    3. While on a Github Issue page, click the bookmark, and a Javascript dialog will open.
    4. Copy the highlighted text in the diaglog and use as your branch name.


This will allow for easy 1-to-1 mapping between github issues and branches.
